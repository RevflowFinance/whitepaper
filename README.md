# Welcome to Revflow

**Revflow** is a next-generation platform that enables businesses to trade their future monthly recurring revenue for the annual amount of revenue upfront, powered by DeFi. There is no debt or dilution incurred; instead, the business takes a discount on the revenue traded based on their financials - this discount makes up the yield for investors. Current TradFi platforms **** either lend the capital out themselves via their balance sheet or only allow institutional investors to participate in revenue trades; Revflow democratises this by building on [<mark style="color:blue;">Solana</mark>](https://solana.com/), allowing both institutional _and_ retail investors to participate, unlocking new investment opportunities in the process and drawing liquidity from the **$200bn** DeFi market.&#x20;

It's time to capitalise on tomorrow, today.
