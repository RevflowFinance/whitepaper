# üåê Platform Overview

The Revflow platform facilitates trading future monthly recurring revenue for the upfront annual amount. We connect businesses seeking capital with investors seeking yield, whilst taking ownership of the risk-analysis and providing a seamless transaction process for both businesses and investors. The difference between us and the rest? We offer a TradFi/CeFi-based front-end for our customers, with all liquidity being sourced from DeFi. This enables us to offer lower discount rates, higher yield rates and unlock this exciting, fast-growing asset class to retail investors.

Our platform is split into two; a business-facing, customer-focused application and an investor-facing, web3-focused application. Bridging the gap between TradFi and DeFi requires careful design on the user interface; make it too complicated, and users will be driven away. We're adopting the dual interface model to ensure the Revflow experience is tailored to the needs of our customers and investors. This model also ensures full separation between sensitive off-chain data and data that is onboarded onto the Solana blockchain for trade fulfilment.&#x20;

Businesses sign up like they would with any other application; via their work email. They connect their payment and banking systems, which kicks off Revflow's credit scoring process, alongside completing KYC/B checks. Once complete, businesses can then trade their future monthly recurring revenue for the upfront annual amount, minus the discount rate which is determined during the credit scoring process (and is on-going during lifetime usage of the platform).&#x20;

Investors connect to the application via wallets; the same as how they would connect to any other DeFi-based application. Junior Tranche investors will undergo a verification process with DeFi referencing tools, such as Civic. They will be given whitelist access to view the necessary metrics to underwrite the trades and partake in the Junior Tranche. Liquidity Pool Investors simply need to connect their wallet to invest, with just one option available - the Liquidity Pool. The Liquidity Pool acts as an index on all the trades funded on the platform alongside reserve yield.&#x20;
