# âš– Business Risk Evaluation

Onboarding businesses onto the Revflow platform and authorising them to trade their future monthly recurring revenue for the annual amount requires a due diligence process that can be completed in as little as 24 hours. The due diligence process will end with a business being told how much future monthly recurring revenue they can trade on the Revflow platform (trading limit) and what discount rates they can expect. All a business needs to do is sign up, connect their systems, undergo KYC/B checks and let us do the legwork. To add, as our scoring process is proprietary, there are no soft or hard searches left on the business's credit report, nor do we leave any markers.

When conducting the credit-scoring process, we look at the following:

* Financial Performance&#x20;
* Financial Metrics (Churn, CAC, LTV, MRR, ARR, ACV etc.)&#x20;
* Benchmarking against similar businesses

This data is plugged into Revflow's Health Score for a business, which scales from 0-1000. The higher the score, the more capital a business can release from their ARR (for example, a business with a score of 950 may be able to release up to 65% of their ARR into upfront capital, whilst a business with a score of 500 may only be able to release up to 50% of their ARR). This score also inversely scales with discount rates; the higher the score, the lower the discount rate. Businesses can improve their score overtime by utilising the platform, growing their business and being above benchmark for similar businesses in their category.&#x20;

The analysis is done off-chain, with only the most necessary information touching the Solana blockchain for the trades to take place. This is discussed further in the Asset Tokenisation section.
