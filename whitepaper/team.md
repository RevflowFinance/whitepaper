# ðŸ¦„ Team

How did Revflow come about? Back in the summer of 2021, we attempted to acquire a small machine-learning SaaS that enhanced audio quality to studio-tier levels. The sale never happened as the application was de-listed from the marketplace. In defeat, we were reading articles on the application and luckily got recommended an article about the opportunities revenue-based assets provided. As we both come from finance backgrounds, (with Aaron being technical and George being functional), we decided to explore this market further and see what options were available.&#x20;

We settled on the trading platform concept as we liked the idea of matching businesses to investors whilst remaining capital-light ourselves and letting investors reap the yield of this emerging asset class, taking a small transaction fee for providing the infrastructure in the process. However, with market saturation setting in, we needed a stronger moat to compete. Having both participated in the crypto markets for several years individually and witnessing the exponential growth of DeFi first-hand, we identified that DeFi itself had a strong opportunity to create multiple moats operating under this model both now and in the future. DeFi enables us to unlock this asset class to retail investors, allows us to provide higher yield and spread the risk for institutional investors and allows us to create a myriad of large opportunities down the line that are not necessarily available to our TradFi competitors.
